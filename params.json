I enjoy my work but my true passion has always been technology. Unfortunately, I was not surrounded by tech savvy family members or given the tools to pursue code at an early age. It was only during college that the idea of understanding the medium I used daily, the internet, and the networks and machines that make it possible peaked my interest. There is no right way to learn, and so the best way to gain understanding is by just doing it. So, here I am. This is my website, its just one small step but not the last.
